First Program with Java

- Every java program starts with a class
- Class naming convention
	- class name should (not must) start with a capital letter
	- class name should be noun
	- class name can only start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
	- file name and class name should be same, because byte code is generated 	  with class name

- Steps to Execute Java Program
	- Open cmd
		1. type - javac FileName.java
			- this command will trigger JDK and compiles the code or we can say that this command generates the byte code
		2. type - java ClassName
			- this command will trigger JVM and JVM will convert the byte code into native code and executes line by line
			- but JVM needs main method to get executed...


Why main is public ?
- 4 types of access specifiers
	public
	protected
	default
	private

Why main is static ?
- because main method needs to be loaded first, and in Java only static things are loaded into memory with class...

Why main is void ?
- because main returns nothing in Java

String args[]
- CLI - command line arguments

What is System ?
- System is a pre-defined class
	- we use System class for 3 purpose
		System.out	  	- to print output on console
		System.in     	- to take input from user
		System.err	 	- to print output in error form

What is out ?
- object of PrintStream class
- used to display output on console

What is println ?
- method inside PrintStream class

Take Input from Command Line
1. Build calculator and perform add, sub, div and mul
2. Take temperature in celcius and convert into fahrenheit
3. Take principal, rate of interest and time as input and 
calculate Simple Interest
