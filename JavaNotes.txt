First Program in Java

- Each java program starts with a class
- Class naming conventions
	- it should be noun
	- class name should (not must) starts with a capital letter
	- class name can only start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
	- class name and file name should (not must) be same

- Execution of a java program
  a. open cmd on the location of code and type 
		- javac FileName.java
		- this command will trigger JDK and compiles the code
		- now our source code will be converted into byte code
  b. now type
		- java ClassName
		- this command will trigger JVM and convert byte code to machine code
		- JVM interpret/execute the code line by line
  c. now insert a main method inside class
		public static void main (String []args) {....}

What is public ?
- Java has 4 types of access specifiers
  public - it could be accessed from anywhere, anyone can access public things
  protected - could be accessed outside a package using inheritance
  default	- could only be accessed within same package
  private - could only be accessed within the class
- JVM search for main method in our program
- because main method is the entry point of our program
- JVM is in some different directory and JVM has to access main method

What is Static ?
- JVM always needs to execute main first
- In java all static things are loaded with class in memory
- if something is non-static in Java then it could be accessed only with object of the class

What is void ?
- Each method has a return type, main is also a method
- void is used when method returns nothing
- main returns nothing in Java

What is String []args ?
- Used for command line arguments

Can we define more than one main method inside one class?
- yes we can define, but only one of them will execute
- only the main method with proper syntax will get executed

Can we interchange public static void ?
- we can interchange public and static
- we cannot interchange void


Data Types
- Primitive
	- fixed memory allocation
	- they all have a default value
	- pre-defined data types

- Non-Primitive
	- dynamic memory allocation
	- they have null value by default
	- user-defined 

Taking Input
- System.in

InputStream - to take input in Java

.in 
- object of InputStream class
- used to take input through keyboard

Buffer
Scanner
- used to store buffer

Control Flow
- If Else
- Loop
- Switch Case

Bitwise Operators

Bitwise AND
a	b	a & b
0	0	  0
0	1	  0
1	0     0
1	1	  1

Bitwise OR
a	b	a | b
0	0	  0
0	1	  1
1	0     1
1	1	  1

Bitwise XOR
a	b	a & b
0	0	  0
0	1	  1
1	0     1
1	1	  0

Bitwise Complement - ~
1s Complement	- convert 0 to 1 and vice versa
2s Complement	- first apply 1s Complement and then add 1 in last bit


Loops
- For
- While
- do...while

- Prime Number
	i/p : 17
	o/p : prime

- Count digits in a number
	i/p : 35214
	o/p : 5

- Count Zeros in a number
	i/p : 104054003
	o/p : 4

- ArmStrong Number
	i/p : 153

- Reverse a number
	i/p : 1234
	o/p : 4321

- LCM
- HCF

- Perfect Number
	- that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors
	i/p : 6 => 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 -> Perfect Number
	i/p : 28
